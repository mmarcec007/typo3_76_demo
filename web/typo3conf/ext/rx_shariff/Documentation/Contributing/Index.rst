Support and Contributing
========================

Translations
------------

The extension may be translated on the official `TYPO3 translation server <https://translation.typo3.org/de/TYPO3.ext.rx_shariff/>`_.
Reelworx maintains the English and German translations, all other translations are very welcome.

Keep in mind that the labels used on the Shariff buttons do not stem from this extension, but
are shipped directly by the upstream Shariff library, which already contains quite a few translations.
The available translations can be found in the project's `readme file <https://github.com/heiseonline/shariff#options-data-attributes>`_.


Support
-------

Support questions are usually answered in the official TYPO3 channels.
That is the English mailinglist/forum and the typo3-cms Slack channel.
