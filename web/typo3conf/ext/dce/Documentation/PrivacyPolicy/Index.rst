Privacy Policy
====================

The backend module of DCE may contain an image which is located on my server. It shows the user if there
is a new DCE version available.

It passes:

- the TYPO3 version
- the DCE version
- and the backend language

Based on these informations I'm able to say: "Yes, a new version is available, but not for your TYPO3 version.". These values are passed completely anonymously and help me to improve the extension.

Because I have the data I am also able to get statistics. Like: Which TYPO3 version is used most often?
I'm going to publish some interesting graphs based on these data on the `Facebook page`_ of DCE extension.

**Since version 0.11.5 this option is disabled by default!**


Enable the update check
-----------------------

In the extension settings of DCE you are able to enable the check of new versions of DCE. Then the image will be embedded and the mentioned data will be passed.
